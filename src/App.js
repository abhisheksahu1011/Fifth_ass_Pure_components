        Pure Components in React are the components which do not re-renders when the value of state and props has been updated with the same values
        </li>
        <li>PureComponent Is Primarily Used for Performance Optimization.</li>
        <li>We can use React.memo for transforming a component into pure component</li>

      * Higher Order Functions
      </h1>
      <ul>
      <li>A higher-order component (HOC) is an advanced technique in React for reusing component logic</li>
      <li>HOCs are not part of the React API,They are a pattern that emerges from React’s compositional nature.</li>
      <li>A higher-order component is a function that takes a component and returns a new component</li>
      </ul>
   <h2>
   * Reason to use Higher-Order component:
   </h2>
   <ul>
     <li>Easy to handle</li>
     <li>Get rid of copying the same logic in every component</li>
